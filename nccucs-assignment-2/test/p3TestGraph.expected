# Graph test.

created graph graph1
created node n1 with cost 6
created node n2 with cost 3
graph1 contains: 
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added edge from n1 to n2 in graph1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: 
shortest path in graph1: n1 n2

created node n3 with cost 1
created node n4 with cost 2
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1
added edge from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge from n2 to n4 in graph1
added edge from n3 to n4 in graph1
shortest path in graph1: n1 n3 n4
